**Abstract**

Testing two potentially multivariate variables for statistical  dependence on the basis finite samples is a fundamental statistical  challenge. Here we explore a family of tests that adapt to the  complexity of the relationship between the variables, promising robust  power across scenarios. Building on the distance correlation, we  introduce a family of adaptive independence criteria based on nonlinear  monotonic transformations of distances. We show that these criteria,  like the distance correlation and RKHS-based criteria, provide  dependence indicators. We propose a class of adaptive (multi-threshold)  test statistics, which form the basis for permutation tests. These tests empirically outperform some of the established tests in average and  worst-case statistical sensitivity across a range of univariate and  multivariate relationships, offer useful insights to the data and may  deserve further exploration.



**Note:** This repository contains early benchmarking codes that generated our empirical results. We are still cleaning up this repository for easy access and run instructions. Stay tuned.
